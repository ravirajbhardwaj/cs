If you want to Learn Any Programming Language you need to know very well two things

1. Data Type
2. Processing

## Introduction to JavaScript

- Developed by **Brendan Eich** in 1995.
- JavaScript is a **loosely** typed, **synchronous**, **single-threaded** language.

<aside>

> In dynamically-typed languages, types are determined at runtime.

> Loosely-typed languages doesn’t strictly enforce type rules. You can mix different types in operations, and the language itself tries to convert them automatically.

<summary>Code Example</summary>

```jsx
let num = 10;     // num is a number
num = "Hello";   // now num is a string (no error!)

console.log(5 + "5");  // Output: "55" (number + string = string)
console.log("5" - 2);  // Output: 3 (string converted to number)
```

## **Variable Declarations**

`var`, `let`, and `const` are the three ways to declare variables.

| **Keyword** | **Can Be Reassigned?** | **Can Be Redeclared?** | TDZ? | Hoisted? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `var` | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| `let` | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| `const` | No | No | Yes | Yes |


> **`const`** only prevents the reassignment of the variable, it doesn’t make the variable immutable. Objects declared with **`const`** can still be mutated.

> You should understand `const` declarations as "create a variable whose *identity* remains constant", not "whose *value* remains constant" — or, "create immutable [bindings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Binding)", not "immutable values".

```jsx
    const nums = [1, 2, 3];
    nums.push(4); // This is allowed, arr is now [1, 2, 3, 4]
