**Computer science is the study of computers and how computer technology can be used to solve problems.**

### How to Build a Strong Foundation:

To build a strong foundation, focus on understanding concepts, not just memorizing, and practice regularly.


### 🔹 Programming
Foundations of programming logic, problem-solving, language concepts, and best practices.

---

### 🔹 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
How data is organized and how problems are solved efficiently.

➡️ [DSA Notes](./DSA/note.md)

---

### 🔹 Operating Systems (OS)
How computers manage processes, memory, files, and hardware resources.

➡️ [OS Notes](./OS/note.md)

---

### 🔹 Computer Networks (CN)
How data moves across systems, protocols, layers, and the internet.

➡️ [CN Notes](./CN/note.md)

---

### 🔹 Databases (DB)
How data is stored, queried, indexed, and scaled reliably.
